Technology is moving inexorably towards top posting.
Because in the war between the technocrats and the rest of us, the common
people won.
The Top Posters Manifesto

* In the technological arena, there are two groups: the technocrats and the
technophobes. Often times, a person might be in one group when it comes to a
specific technology, but in another group when it comes to a different
technology. The technocrats use the technology on a deeper level, while the
technophobes use the technology on a wider range. This means that often times,
while one group might understand a given technology better, they might still
cover only a limited number of the use-cases and user-base.

* As the more capable side, it falls upon the technocrats to make the effort
to bridge the gap between themselves and the other users of the technology. The
majority of the audience is who ultimately defines the use of the technology.

* Technocrats appreciated the discursive nature of branching, contextual 
discussions - threaded mail readers, context posting with multiple levels of 
quoting, hierarchical web forums. But in this garden of branching paths, many
users lose their way, tl;dr - they refuse the technocratic demand to absorb
the entire context of a discussion before participating/

* The adaptiveness of technology to the average user (who is, usually, the
technophobe) can be seen in ample examples, such as blogs, feeds (RSS, news)
and social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter). They all conform to the
top-posting convention. 

* It is not always the right decision to top-post. Above all, it is important
not to be correct, but adaptive.
